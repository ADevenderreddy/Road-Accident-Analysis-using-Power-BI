# Road Accidents Data Analysis Using Power BI

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data using Power BI to uncover key insights and trends. By leveraging interactive visualizations and dashboards, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of accident patterns, contributing factors, and potential areas for safety improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on road accidents, such as:
- Date and time of accidents
- Location details (city, state, or country)
- Number of casualties
- Type of vehicles involved
- Weather and road conditions
- Possible causes of accidents

## Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- Identify trends and patterns in road accidents.
- Understand the impact of factors like weather, location, and time on accident frequency.
- Provide actionable insights for policymakers and traffic safety authorities.
- Enhance data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Data Visualization Insights
Using Power BI, the following key insights were derived:
- **Accident Frequency by Time & Location**: A heatmap showing peak accident times and high-risk locations.
- **Casualty Analysis**: Breakdown of minor, serious, and fatal injuries.
- **Vehicle Involvement**: Most common types of vehicles in accidents.
- **Weather Impact**: Relationship between accidents and adverse weather conditions.
- **Yearly Trends**: Visualization of accident trends over multiple years.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **CSV Data Processing**: Data cleaning and transformation.

## Results & Findings
- Peak accident times are generally during rush hours.
- Urban areas have a higher frequency of accidents compared to rural locations.
- Bad weather conditions (rain, fog, snow) significantly increase accident rates.
- Motorcycles and trucks are among the most frequently involved vehicles.
